ConnectTel Telecom Company faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth. The company's current customer retention strategies lack precision and effectiveness, resulting in the loss of valuable customers to competitors.

To overcome this challenge, ConnectTel aims to develop a robust customer churn prediction system for which you have been contacted to handle as a Data Scientist. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on available customer data, the company seeks to accurately forecast customer churn and implement targeted retention initiatives.

This proactive approach will enable ConnectTel to reduce customer attrition, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and competitive telecommunications industry.

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered customer data from ConnectTel's database, including information such as customer ID, gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents, tenure, and more.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. Handled missing values and converted categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand the relationships between key features and customer churn. Visualized data, explored correlations, and performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to gain insights.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical variables, created new features, and standardized numerical features where necessary. Developed additional features from existing data to improve model performance.
5. **Model Selection and Training:** Explored multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn. Trained and evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Analyzed the results of the trained models, identified key metrics for assessing model performance, and made recommendations based on the findings.
7. **GitHub Repository:** Published the Jupyter Notebook to a GitHub repository to share the code and analysis with team members and stakeholders.

**[Challenges Faced](url)**

- **Data Quality:** Dealing with missing data and ensuring data accuracy was a primary challenge. Some records had missing values that required careful handling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful new features from the available data required a deep understanding of the telecom industry and customer behavior.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the most appropriate machine learning model for churn prediction and fine-tuning hyperparameters was a complex decision.
- **Interpretable Results:** Ensuring that the results and predictions were interpretable and actionable for ConnectTel's business was a constant consideration.
